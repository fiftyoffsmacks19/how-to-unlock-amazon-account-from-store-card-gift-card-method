For starters you need 
1.A locked account 
2.Billing address
3.Last 4 digits of a card stored on your account
4.Expiration date of that card
5.Something on your amazon wishlist but if you don't have anything there they'll probably ask another question.
6.active number on the account

Start by making a new account and heading over to settings
and find customer service 

Click something else/ or need more help until you locate 
Request a call

Type your number in and someone will call i maybe 1-5 mins
They will ask ownership questions like was the 
credit card used yours, respond yes

Keep in mind be respectful as possible -yes/no sir/maam 
Tell them all the info but after this they won't ask anymore questions about the store card

you will receive a link asking you to reset password and wait 2 hours
contact them once and again and they'll ask for your name, give them account name 
and you will be transferred over to account management where they will ask security questions 
1. email to account
2.last 4 digits of a card on account
3. expiration date
4.billing address (your address)
5.something on your wish list (if you don't have anything on your wishlist be prepared for something along the lines of that)
